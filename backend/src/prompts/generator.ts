## Field Reference

### Module
- **name**: Display name for the module/menu
- **case_type**: Required if any form is "registration" or "followup". Use a short snake_case name (e.g. "patient", "household_visit"). Only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens.
- **forms**: Array of forms in this module
- **case_list_columns**: Columns shown in the case list. Each has "field" (case property name) and "header" (display text). Do NOT include "name" — it's shown automatically. Do NOT use reserved property names.

### Form
- **name**: Display name
- **type**: One of:
  - "registration" — creates a new case. MUST have case_name_field.
  - "followup" — updates an existing case. Should have case_preload to pre-fill fields with existing case data.
  - "survey" — no case management (standalone data collection).
- **case_name_field**: (registration only) The question id whose value becomes the case name.
- **case_properties**: Map of case property name → question id. These question values get saved to the case.
  - Do NOT include the case_name_field here — it's saved automatically.
  - NEVER use reserved property names as keys (see list below).
  - NEVER map media/binary questions (image, audio, video, signature) to case properties — CommCare cannot store binary data in case properties. Only map text, numeric, date, and select values.
- **case_preload**: (followup only) Map of question id → case property name. Pre-fills form questions with existing case data when the form opens.
  - The question gets populated with the case property's current value.
  - To load the case name, use "case_name" as the value (reading reserved properties is fine).
  - If the user should be able to EDIT a preloaded value and save it back, include the same field in BOTH case_preload AND case_properties.
- **close_case**: (followup only, optional) Closes the parent case when this form is submitted.
  - Set to \`true\` for forms that ALWAYS close the case (e.g., dedicated "Close Case" or "Discharge" forms).
  - Set to \`{"question": "question_id", "answer": "value"}\` for CONDITIONAL close — the case closes only when that question's answer matches the value.
  - Omit entirely if the form should NOT close the case (default).
  - Only valid on "followup" forms (you must select a case before you can close it).
- **child_cases**: (optional) Creates child/sub-cases linked to the current case. Array of objects:
  - "case_type": (required) The child case type in snake_case (e.g. "referral", "pregnancy", "household_member")
  - "case_name_field": (required) Question id whose value becomes the child case name
  - "case_properties": (optional) Map of child case property name → question id
  - "relationship": (optional) "child" (default) or "extension". Use "extension" when the child should prevent the parent from being closed.
  - "repeat_context": (optional) Question id of a repeat group — creates one child case per repeat entry.
  - Valid on both "registration" and "followup" forms. The parent case index is set automatically.
- **questions**: Array of questions in the form.

### Question
- **id**: Unique identifier within the form. Use snake_case (e.g. "patient_name", "visit_date"). Must start with a letter.
- **type**: One of: "text", "phone", "secret", "int", "decimal", "long", "date", "time", "datetime", "select1", "select", "geopoint", "barcode", "image", "audio", "video", "signature", "trigger", "hidden", "group", "repeat"
  - "text" = free text input (also used for fields that get pre-filled from case data)
  - "phone" = phone number / numeric ID input (shows numeric keyboard, stores as string)
  - "secret" = password / PIN input (input is masked)
  - "int" = whole number, "decimal" = decimal number, "long" = large whole number
  - "date" = date picker, "time" = time picker, "datetime" = date and time picker
  - "select1" = single-select dropdown, "select" = multi-select checkboxes
  - "geopoint" = GPS location capture
  - "barcode" = barcode/QR code scanner
  - "image" = photo capture, "audio" = audio recording, "video" = video recording
  - "signature" = signature capture pad
  - "trigger" = acknowledgment button (OK button, no data entry — do NOT use for displaying case data)
  - "hidden" = hidden calculated value (not shown to user — use with "calculate" field)
  - "group" = question group displayed together on one screen (use "children" array for nested questions)
  - "repeat" = repeating group — user can add multiple entries (use "children" array for nested questions)
- **label**: Human-readable question text. Write clear, natural labels like "Patient Name", "Date of Birth", "Blood Pressure". Never put technical notes like "(loaded from case)" in labels.
- **hint**: (optional) Help text shown below the question
- **required**: (optional) true if the question must be answered
- **readonly**: (optional) true if the field should be visible but not editable (use for display-only preloaded values)
- **constraint**: (optional) XPath constraint expression, e.g. ". > 0 and . < 150"
- **constraint_msg**: (optional) Error message when constraint fails
- **relevant**: (optional) XPath expression — question only shows when this is true, e.g. "/data/age > 18"
- **calculate**: (optional) XPath expression for auto-computed value (use with type "hidden" for background calculations)
- **options**: (required for select1/select) Array of {value, label} pairs
- **children**: (required for group/repeat) Array of nested question objects

## RESERVED Case Property Names — NEVER use these ANYWHERE (not in case_properties, not in case_preload):
case_id, case_name, case_type, closed, closed_by, closed_on, date, date_modified, date_opened, doc_type, domain, external_id, index, indices, modified_on, name, opened_by, opened_on, owner_id, server_modified_on, status, type, user_id, xform_id

Use descriptive alternatives: visit_date, patient_type, case_status, full_name, etc.
Do NOT try to preload case_name — the case name is already shown when the user selects a case from the list.

## Smart Type Selection — ALWAYS use the most specific type
- Phone numbers, mobile numbers, contact numbers, numeric IDs → "phone" (NOT "text")
- Passwords, PINs, security codes → "secret" (NOT "text")
- Dates (birth date, visit date, due date) → "date" (NOT "text")
- Times (appointment time, shift start) → "time" (NOT "text")
- Date + time together → "datetime"
- Age, count, number of children, quantity → "int" (NOT "text")
- Weight, height, temperature, BMI, price → "decimal" (NOT "text")
- Yes/No, Male/Female, any fixed choices → "select1" with options (NOT "text")
- Multiple selections (symptoms, services) → "select" with options
- GPS/location capture → "geopoint"
- Photos, ID photos, wound photos → "image"
- Voice notes, recorded interviews → "audio"
- Video evidence, demonstrations → "video"
- Consent signatures, approval signatures → "signature"
- Scan barcodes or QR codes → "barcode"
- Calculated values (BMI, age from DOB, risk score, total) → "hidden" with "calculate"
- Groups of related questions shown together → "group" with "children"
- Repeating entries (multiple children, multiple visits) → "repeat" with "children"
- ONLY use "text" for truly free-text fields: names, addresses, notes, descriptions, comments

## Case Lifecycle — Closing Cases and Creating Child Cases

Think about the FULL lifecycle of a case. Don't just register and update — recognize when cases should close and when child cases should be created.

### When to close cases — set close_case on followup forms
Recognize these patterns from form names and user requests:
- Dedicated close/end forms: "Close Case", "Discharge Patient", "Exit Program", "Archive Record", "End Treatment" → close_case: true
- Death or final outcome forms: "Death Notification", "Final Assessment", "Case Resolution" → close_case: true
- Forms with outcome questions where some answers mean the case is done:
  - "Outcome" with "discharged", "deceased", "transferred out", "completed" → close_case: {"question": "outcome", "answer": "discharged"}
  - "Program Status" with "graduated", "dropped out", "completed" → conditional close on the exit answer
- User says words like "close", "discharge", "exit", "end", "archive", "complete", "finish", "terminate", "deactivate" about a form → use close_case
- If a form ALWAYS closes the case (no conditional logic needed), use close_case: true
- If only SOME outcomes close the case, use close_case: {"question": "id", "answer": "closing_value"} — pick the one closing answer, or use close_case: true with a required confirmation question

### When to create child cases — set child_cases
Recognize these patterns:
- "Register X under Y" (e.g., "register a pregnancy under a mother") → child case type "pregnancy" on the parent "mother" form
- "Add a referral" → child case type "referral"
- "Register household members" → child cases in a repeat group (set repeat_context)
- "Create a visit record / encounter" → child case type "visit"
- "Log a pregnancy / immunization / service" → child case type for the sub-entity
- Any time the user describes an entity that belongs to / is owned by the parent case
- If multiple child entries are needed in one form submission, use a repeat group with repeat_context
- Use "extension" relationship only when the child must prevent the parent from closing (e.g., active pregnancy prevents closing the mother case)

## Rules
1. Every module with registration or followup forms MUST have a case_type.
2. Every registration form MUST have case_name_field pointing to a valid question id.
3. Every form MUST have at least one question.
4. Question ids must be unique within a form and use snake_case starting with a letter.
5. select1/select questions MUST have at least 2 options.
6. case_properties keys must NOT be reserved words. case_properties values must reference valid question ids.
7. case_preload keys must reference valid question ids. case_preload values must NOT be reserved words.
8. For followup forms, use real input fields (text, date, select1, etc.) for preloaded values — NOT triggers. Use readonly: true if you want a display-only field.
9. Design forms that are genuinely useful. Every question should serve a purpose. Labels should be clear and professional.

\`\`\`

In this example:
- The registration form creates a patient case. patient_name becomes the case name. age, gender, phone are saved as case properties.
- The follow-up form PRELOADS the current status and phone from the case into readonly fields. The worker sees existing data and fills in new visit details. visit_status and last_visit_date get saved back to the case.
- The discharge form CONDITIONALLY closes the case — only when the user confirms "Yes". The discharge reason and date are saved to the case before closing.
- The case name is NOT preloaded — it's already shown when the user selects the case from the list.
- The case list shows age, gender, and status columns (name is shown automatically by HQ).
